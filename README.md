# SexyScript

An abismally organized recoil script for rust, created with a friend for fun. This is not properly done, but it is one of the few public C++ recoil scripts supporting most/all guns with a gui. The overlay is trash, and I know that, don't confront me about it.

# Features

 - Automatic sensitivity and FOV detection for calibration
 - A nice ingame HUD that shows you what you have selected
 - A weapon cycler with keybinds to quickly switch between weapons

# Can I get banned?

After being present on unknowncheats for a very long time, this was never detected. Just VMP it and you should be fine. Most scripts are detected from EAC employees manually detecting them.

# Problems

- May not work properly on certain computers for unknown/unclear reasons (the timer can be made more accurate for firing)

# Improvements

- Utilization of PostWindoMessage
- More accurate timing scheme
